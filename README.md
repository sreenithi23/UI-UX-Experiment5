# UI-UX-Experiment5
## Aim:
To design and prototype an interactive Flipkart mobile application interface using Figma, focusing on an intuitive user experience for product browsing, searching, and purchasing.

## Algorithm:
Problem Identification:
Understand user needs for a seamless e-commerce shopping experience.Analyze Flipkart’s existing UI and identify areas for simplification and improvement.

Requirement Gathering:
Tools: Figma (for design and prototyping).
Components: Icons, images, typography, and Material Design / iOS UI kits.

Design Planning:

UI Design:
Use color schemes and brand elements (Flipkart blue and yellow).Add navigation bars, product cards, icons, and text sections.Incorporate UI components from Material Design and Simple Design System libraries.

Prototype Creation:
Link buttons and navigation elements between screens using Figma’s Prototype mode.Enable interactive flow (e.g., Home → Search → Product Details → Buy Now).

Testing and Feedback:
Review prototype interactions for usability.Collect feedback and make necessary design adjustments.

Final Presentation:
Export screens and demonstrate app navigation.Document the design flow and user journey.
